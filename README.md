## üìñ Project Description  
The **Philosophers** project is an implementation of the classic **Dining Philosophers problem**, a synchronization challenge where multiple threads (philosophers) compete for shared resources (forks) without deadlocks or starvation.  

Key behaviors:  
- Philosophers alternate between **thinking**, **eating**, and **sleeping**.  
- Each needs **two forks** to eat (shared resources with neighbors).  
- The solution avoids **deadlocks** (e.g., circular waits) and ensures fairness.
